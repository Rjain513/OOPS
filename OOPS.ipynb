        "Ans1) Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around \"objects\" rather than functions or logic. An object can be thought of as a real-world entity that has characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans2) In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have. A class essentially describes the structure and functionality of objects but doesn't represent a specific instance itself until an object (or instance) is created from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans3)In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that is created based on the class blueprint. An object contains both data (attributes) and behavior (methods), which are defined by its class. Objects are the fundamental units that bring classes to life in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans4)In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), both abstraction and encapsulation are key concepts that help in organizing and managing complex systems.\n",
        "Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complexity of the system and exposing only the necessary parts. It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
        "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also involves restricting access to some of the object's components, thus preventing unauthorized or inappropriate modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans5)Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore methods\"), also known as magic methods or special methods, are predefined methods in Python that have double underscores (__) before and after their names. They allow you to define how objects of a class behave in different situations, such as when they are printed, added, or compared.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans6) Inheritance is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class), promoting code reusability and hierarchical relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans7) Polymorphism (from the Greek words poly = \"many\" and morph = \"forms\") is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling a single interface to work with different types.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans8) Encapsulation is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is the concept of hiding the internal details of an object and only exposing the necessary functionalities. This helps in data protection, modular design, and code maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans9) A constructor is a special method in Python used to initialize objects when a class is instantiated. It is automatically called when a new object of the class is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans10) In object-oriented programming (OOP), both class methods and static methods are used to define behaviors related to a class rather than individual instances. In finance, they are useful for performing calculations, formatting data, and working with financial models.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans11) Method Overloading is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where multiple methods have the same name but different parameters (number or type). The method that gets executed is determined based on the arguments passed.\n",
        "Python does not support traditional method overloading like Java\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans12) Method Overriding is an OOP feature where a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "The overridden method in the child class must have the same name, return type, and parameters as in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans13)The @property decorator in Python is used to define getters, setters, and deleters in a class. It allows us to control access to an attribute while using it like a normal variable.\n",

        "       Facilitates Interface Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans15) An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It contains abstract methods (methods with no implementation) that must be implemented in subclasses.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans18)Method chaining is a technique in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line. This is done by returning self from each method, allowing subsequent method calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans19) The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called as a function. When an object has __call__ defined, it can be used like a function, enabling flexible and intuitive syntax.\n",
